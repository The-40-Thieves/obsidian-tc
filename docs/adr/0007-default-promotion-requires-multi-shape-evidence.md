# Default promotion requires multi-shape evidence; single-vault wins ship as preset evidence

ADR 0003 governs what happens when a mechanism *loses*: it ships dark, reachable, with its numbers
on the ticket. Nothing in this project ever governed what happens when a mechanism *wins* — every
flag that clears the non-inferiority gate has defaulted ON project-wide off a single golden set
measured against one private ~1,150-note personal vault. That asymmetry is the gap this ADR closes.
A ship rule that audits losses this carefully and lets wins through unaudited is not a stricter gate,
it is a gate with one open side.

**A single-collection win is not general evidence, and the field has known this for a while.**
BEIR's own contribution was showing that retrievers ranked on one collection routinely reorder on
the next — there is no universal winner across its corpora, only per-shape ones. Armstrong et al.
(CIKM 2009) found ad-hoc retrieval "improvements" published against a single TREC collection
frequently failed to beat a strong baseline once compared honestly across collections. Fuhr (SIGIR
Forum 2017) named the underlying failure mode directly: a significance test answers "is this real on
*this* sample," never "does this generalize," and treating the two as the same question is how a
field accumulates findings that do not replicate. None of this is a knock on the harness in
`packages/server/eval/` — its statistics are sound for the question it asks. The problem is the
question a single vault can answer at all.

**Production search engines have already converged on the fix, and it is not "measure harder."**
Elasticsearch, Qdrant and Vespa all ship RRF with a fixed rank constant, opt-in re-ranking and fusion
knobs, and eval tooling handed to the operator rather than baked into the product's own defaults.
The pattern is: ship the flat-optimum constant everywhere, gate anything corpus-shaped behind an
opt-in, and let the deployer measure their own collection instead of inheriting the vendor's. That
is the shape this ADR adopts.

**Three classes of flag, three different evidence bars.**

*(a) Corpus-insensitive mechanisms* — flat-optimum constants whose behavior does not meaningfully
change with corpus shape — may default ON on single-vault evidence. RRF's rank constant is the
textbook case: the folklore k=60 is documented as insensitive enough that Elasticsearch, Qdrant and
Vespa all ship it unconditionally, with no per-corpus tuning path. Note what this class does *not*
cover: `graph_search.ts`'s own `rrfK=10` default (THE-397) is not this project's example of class
(a) — its own code comment says the k=10-over-k=60 effect "appears only below the pool-size
crossover," which is a statement about pool depth, a corpus fact, not a flat optimum. It belongs in
class (b) below, mis-filed as a settled default until this ADR named the category.

*(b) Vault-fact-conditional settings* — flags whose right value depends on measurable properties of
the index (language, note count, doc-length variance, link density, retrieval-pool depth) — should
derive from those measured statistics at index time, not ship as a fixed constant tuned on one
vault's statistics and assumed portable. Nothing in this class exists yet; making `rrfK`,
`knnMinSim`, and similar depend on measured index stats rather than a hardcoded default is future
work, not built, and is the natural next stop for the `rrfK`/pool-size finding above once someone
takes it on.

*(c) Judgment-dependent mechanisms* — everything whose ranking effect is a genuine judgment call
rather than a corpus-measurable fact — defaults OFF until it wins-or-ties on a majority of a
multi-shape eval suite: three or more corpora of different shape, size and language, with no
catastrophic loss on any of them. A single-vault win on this class does not earn a global default.
It earns a narrower, still-real claim: the mechanism is "validated on: personal-notes shape," which
qualifies it for a vault-shape preset a personal-notes user can opt into — never a flip of the
project-wide default.

**The statistical case for the floor, not just the taxonomy.** Every default-flip decision in this
project's history has been drawn from the same uncorrected α = 0.05 gate, one decision at a time.
Fifteen such gates — a plausible count for a project that has now shipped this many retrieval flags
— carry a family-wise false-flip probability of 1 − 0.95¹⁵ ≈ 53.7%: coin-flip odds that *at least
one* of the flags currently defaulted on on the strength of a single-vault win is there by chance
rather than by a real effect. The Benjamini–Hochberg control `packages/server/eval/stats.ts` already
runs (q = 0.1) covers the *within-run* family — the metrics compared in one sweep — and was never
designed to, and does not, cover the *across-experiment* family this 53.7% describes. One measured
data point makes the risk concrete rather than hypothetical: THE-397's own recorded numbers (n=32,
ΔnDCG 0.444 → 0.426, i.e. a 0.018 mean delta) sit below the ≈0.10 minimum detectable effect this
project's own harness later established as necessary at that same n. That is not grounds to flip
`rrfK` back — doing so would itself be an unaudited single-vault change, the exact move this ADR
argues against — it is grounds to be honest about what evidence a shipped default currently rests
on. Single-vault permutation tests are not devalued by this; they are demoted to the job they can
actually do reliably: **regression tests**, catching a change that breaks the measured corpus. That
was always their most valuable use; this ADR just stops asking them to also answer a generalization
question they were never powered for.

**Rollout.** No existing default flips as a result of this ADR — `rrfK=10` and every other flag
promoted on single-vault evidence keep their current setting. What changes is the label: each such
default is documented with the evidence it actually rests on (flat-optimum constant, vault-shape
preset candidate, or unaudited single-vault win awaiting the suite below), not left to read as
though it cleared a bar it never faced. The multi-shape suite itself is future work, gated on public
corpora existing to build it from. Shape #1 already exists and is in use — the Matuschak evergreen
notes corpus this project already publishes a number against (`docs/EVALUATION.md`, "Published on a
public corpus"). The two missing shapes are a code-documentation corpus and a CJK corpus; both are
named rather than merely implied because sourcing them is tracked work, referenced here in prose as
THE-884 and THE-637. Until the suite exists, no *new* mechanism is promoted to a global default off
a single-vault win — it may still ship dark per ADR 0003, or ship labeled as a personal-notes-shape
preset per class (c) above.

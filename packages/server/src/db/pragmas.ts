/**
 * The per-connection baseline every adapter applies (THE-273), as pragma BODIES without the
 * `PRAGMA ` keyword: better-sqlite3's `pragma()` takes them bare, and the other two adapters
 * template the keyword back on.
 *
 * It lives here rather than inline in each adapter because it was previously copied into all
 * three, and a defect in the ORDER was therefore present in all three (THE-745 / #719).
 *
 * **The order is load-bearing, and `busy_timeout` MUST stay first.** SQLite's busy handler is
 * per-connection state installed BY the `busy_timeout` pragma; until it runs, a connection has no
 * handler at all and contention returns `SQLITE_BUSY` immediately instead of retrying. Converting
 * a database INTO WAL needs an EXCLUSIVE lock, so when several connections open a not-yet-WAL
 * database at once — a fresh install, a wiped cacheDir, the first boot after a cache reset — the
 * losers threw at ~0.3 ms rather than waiting out the timeout. Failing FAST is the signature of an
 * absent handler; failing at ~`busy_timeout` would mean the handler worked and contention genuinely
 * outlived it. Once a database is in WAL the conversion is a no-op and the window closes, which is
 * why a long-running deployment never reproduces this and a first boot does.
